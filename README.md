An Android Application to book Doctor's Appointment.<br>
We are not well acquainted with Github,so there were many changes done while updating the repository.<br>
As of now we have created an Android application for a local clinic where user can Login and Book an Appointment.<br>
We have created 2 modules i.e one for Doctor and another one for Patient.<br>
Home Page design has been completed.<br>
Online appointment booking form feature is also added and that form data can be viewed by the doctor.<br>
Google map API is used for the Clinic Location.<br>
About us and Feedback section is provided.<br>
Currently working on the the Video Call Consultation module.<br>
